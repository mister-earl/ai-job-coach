# AI Job Coach

**The Problem:** Job searching is emotionally brutal. Most career tools ignore the feelings part - the anxiety, frustration, and uncertainty that actually drive job search behavior.

**The Solution:** A feelings-first approach that acknowledges your emotional state before offering practical tools. Because how you feel affects how you apply, network, and present yourself.

## Why I Built This
After experiencing my own layoff and job search anxiety, I realized most career tools treat job searching like a purely logical process. They ignore the emotional reality - that being anxious affects how you write cover letters, that feeling confident changes how you network.

This tool acknowledges that feelings are data, then provides appropriate guidance for your mental state.

## Current Status
**MVP/Prototype** - The resume optimization feature currently uses mock responses to demonstrate the concept. AI integration for resume generation is planned for v2.
